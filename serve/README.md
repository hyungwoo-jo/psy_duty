# Local Static Server (no project changes)

This folder contains a tiny Python server to serve the project on a unique localhost port, mounted under a subpath (default ). It does not modify any existing files.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (comes preinstalled on most systems)

## Usage
- Auto-pick a free port and serve under :
  - 
- Specify a port (e.g., 51745) and custom prefix (e.g., ):
  - 
- Open the printed URL (e.g., ) in your browser.

## Notes
- The server serves the repository root, mounted at the chosen prefix (so  is at ). Relative asset paths keep working.
- Use  to stop the server.
